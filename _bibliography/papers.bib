  abstract = {This paper is the fruit of a partnership with Renault. Their reverse logistic requires solving a continent-scale multiattribute inventory routing problem (IRP). With an average of 30 commodities, 16 depots, and 600 customers spread across a continent, our instances are orders of magnitude larger than those in the literature. Existing algorithms do not scale, so we propose a large neighborhood search (LNS). To make it work, (1) we generalize existing split delivery vehicle routing problems and IRP neighborhoods to this context, (2) we turn a state-of-the-art matheuristic for medium-scale IRP into a large neighborhood, and (3) we introduce two novel perturbations: the reinsertion of a customer and that of a commodity into the IRP solution. We also derive a new lower bound based on a flow relaxation. In order to stimulate the research on large-scale IRP, we introduce a library of industrial instances. We benchmark our algorithms on these instances and make our code open source. Extensive numerical experiments highlight the relevance of each component of our LNS.

  abstract = {We investigate popular resampling methods for estimating the uncertainty of statistical models, such as subsampling, bootstrap and the jackknife, and their performance in high-dimensional supervised regression tasks. We provide a tight asymptotic description of the biases and variances estimated by these methods in the context of generalized linear models, such as ridge and logistic regression, taking the limit where the number of samples \$n\$ and dimension \$d\$ of the covariates grow at a comparable rate: \$\textbackslash alpha=n/d\$ fixed. Our findings are three-fold: i) resampling methods are fraught with problems in high dimensions and exhibit the double-descent-like behavior typical of these situations; ii) only when \$\textbackslash alpha\$ is large enough do they provide consistent and reliable error estimations (we give convergence rates); iii) in the over-parametrized regime \$\textbackslash alpha{$<$}1\$ relevant to modern machine learning practice, their predictions are not consistent, even with optimal regularization.},

  abstract = {Combinatorial optimization (CO) layers in machine learning (ML) pipelines are a powerful tool to tackle data-driven decision tasks, but they come with two main challenges. First, the solution of a CO problem often behaves as a piecewise constant function of its objective parameters. Given that ML pipelines are typically trained using stochastic gradient descent, the absence of slope information is very detrimental. Second, standard ML losses do not work well in combinatorial settings. A growing body of research addresses these challenges through diverse methods. Unfortunately, the lack of well-maintained implementations slows down the adoption of CO layers. In this paper, building upon previous works, we introduce a probabilistic perspective on CO layers, which lends itself naturally to approximate differentiation and the construction of structured losses. We recover many approaches from the literature as special cases, and we also derive new ones. Based on this unifying perspective, we present InferOpt.jl, an open-source Julia package that 1) allows turning any CO oracle with a linear objective into a differentiable layer, and 2) defines adequate losses to train pipelines containing such layers. Our library works with arbitrary optimization algorithms, and it is fully compatible with Julia's ML ecosystem. We demonstrate its abilities using a pathfinding problem on video game maps as guiding example, as well as three other applications from operations research.},

  abstract = {This thesis investigates the frontier between machine learning and combinatorial optimization, two active areas of applied mathematics research. We combine theoretical insights with efficient algorithms, and develop several open source Julia libraries. Inspired by a collaboration with the Société nationale des chemins de fer français (SNCF), we study high-impact use cases from the railway world: train failure prediction, delay propagation, and track allocation. In Part I, we provide mathematical background and describe software implementations for various tools that will be needed later on: implicit differentiation, temporal point processes, Hidden Markov Models and Multi-Agent Path Finding. Our publicly available code fills a void in the Julia package ecosystem, aiming at ease of use without compromising on performance. In Part II, we highlight theoretical contributions related to both statistics and decision-making. We consider a Vector AutoRegressive process with partial observations, and prove matching upper and lower bounds on the estimation error. We unify and extend the state of the art for combinatorial optimization layers in deep learning, gathering various approaches in a Julia library called InferOpt.jl. We also seek to differentiate through multi-objective optimization layers, which leads to a novel theory of lexicographic convex analysis. In Part III, these mathematical and algorithmic foundations come together to tackle railway problems. We design a hierarchical model of train failures, propose a graph-based framework for delay propagation, and suggest new avenues for track allocation, with the Flatland challenge as a testing ground.},

  abstract = {High-dimensional time series are a core ingredient of the statistical modeling toolkit, for which numerous estimation methods are known.But when observations are scarce or corrupted, the learning task becomes much harder.The question is: how much harder? In this paper, we study the properties of a partially-observed Vector AutoRegressive process, which is a state-space model endowed with a stochastic observation mechanism.Our goal is to estimate its sparse transition matrix, but we only have access to a small and noisy subsample of the state components.Interestingly, the sampling process itself is random and can exhibit temporal correlations, a feature shared by many realistic data acquisition scenarios.We start by describing an estimator based on the Yule-Walker equation and the Dantzig selector, and we give an upper bound on its non-asymptotic error.Then, we provide a matching minimax lower bound, thus proving near-optimality of our estimator.The convergence rate we obtain sheds light on the role of several key parameters such as the sampling ratio, the amount of noise and the number of non-zero coefficients in the transition matrix.These theoretical findings are commented and illustrated by numerical experiments on simulated data.},

  abstract = {For Graph Neural Networks, oversmoothing denotes the homogenization of vertex embeddings as the number of layers increases. To better understand this phenomenon, we study community detection with a linearized Graph Convolutional Network on the Contextual Stochastic Block Model. We express the distribution of the embeddings in each community as a Gaussian mixture over a low-dimensional latent space, with explicit formulas in the case of a single layer. This yields tractable estimators for classification accuracy at finite depth. Numerical experiments suggest that modeling with a single Gaussian is insufficient and that the impact of depth may be more complex than previously anticipated.},

  abstract = {From implicit differentiation to probabilistic modeling, Jacobians and Hessians have many potential use cases in Machine Learning (ML), but conventional wisdom views them as computationally prohibitive. Fortunately, these matrices often exhibit sparsity, which can be leveraged to significantly speed up the process of Automatic Differentiation (AD). This paper presents advances in Automatic Sparse Differentiation (ASD), starting with a new perspective on sparsity detection. Our refreshed exposition is based on operator overloading, able to detect both local and global sparsity patterns, and naturally avoids dead ends in the control flow graph. We also describe a novel ASD pipeline in Julia, consisting of independent software packages for sparsity detection, matrix coloring, and differentiation, which together enable ASD based on arbitrary AD backends. Our pipeline is fully automatic and requires no modification of existing code, making it compatible with existing ML codebases. We demonstrate that this pipeline unlocks Jacobian and Hessian matrices at scales where they were considered too expensive to compute. On real-world problems from scientific ML and optimization, we show significant speed-ups of up to three orders of magnitude. Notably, our ASD pipeline often outperforms standard AD for one-off computations, once thought impractical due to slower sparsity detection methods.},
