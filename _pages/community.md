## Resource sharing

I have built the website [PhD Resources](https://phd-resources.github.io/) to help students and researchers find the tools they need.

## Peer review

I have been a reviewer for the following journals:

- Journal of Open Source Software
- Transportation Research

as well as the following conferences:

- JuliaCon & JuliaCon proceedings (2021, 2022, 2023)
- NeurIPS (2023)
- ICML (2023)

## Scientific communication

Whenever I can, I try to make science more accessible and fun.
I have worked with the [Science Comedy Show](https://sciencecomedyshow.com/) on science popularization.
I have also taken part in the regional "3-minute thesis competition".

## Music

In my spare time, I like to write song parodies about research and academic life, both in French and in English.
