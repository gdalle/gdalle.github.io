I am a tenured researcher at [Ã‰cole des Ponts](https://ecoledesponts.fr/) (France), in the [LVMT](https://www.lvmt.fr/) team. Previously I was a postdoc at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/)(Switzerland) and a visiting student at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) (USA).

My scientific interests range from applied mathematics and computer science (on the theoretical side) to the study and optimization of transportation systems (on the applied side). I am also very enthusiastic about open-source software and the Julia programming language. If you want to discuss these topics, please reach out!
